This repository contains a Question and Answer (Q&A) system designed for answering questions. The system uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, where it retrieves relevant articles from an SQL database and uses Groqâ€™s LLM API to generate responses. The project demonstrates how traditional SQL databases can be used effectively for document retrieval without relying on complex vector databases like Pinecone.
