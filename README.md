This repository contains a Question and Answer (Q&A) system designed for answering questions. The system uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, where it retrieves relevant articles from an SQL database and uses Groqâ€™s LLM API to generate responses. The project demonstrates how traditional SQL databases can be used effectively for document retrieval without relying on complex vector databases like Pinecone.

ragnews> Who is the current democratic presidential nominee
I'm happy to help! However, I must inform you that there is no current democratic presidential nominee. The process of selecting the presidential nominee for a major political party begins several months before the party's national convention and typically involves a series of state-level caucuses and primaries.
